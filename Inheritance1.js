class StationaryBike {
    constructor(position, gears) {
        this.position = position
        this.gears = gears
    }
}

class Treadmill {
    constructor(position, modes) {
        this.position = position
        this.modes = modes
    }
}

class Gym {
    constructor(openHrs, stationaryBikePos, treadmillPos) {
        this.openHrs = openHrs
        this.stationaryBike = new StationaryBike(stationaryBikePos, 8)
        this.treadmill = new Treadmill(treadmillPos, 5)
    }
}

var boxingGym = new Gym("7-22", "right corner", "left corner")

console.log(boxingGym.openHrs) //
console.log(boxingGym.stationaryBike) //
console.log(boxingGym.treadmill) //

class NoDefaultParams {
    constructor(num1, num2, num3, string1, bool1) {
        this.num1 = num1;
        this.num2 = num2;
        this.num3 = num3;
        this.string1 = string1;
        this.bool1 = bool1;
    }
    calculate() {
        if(this.bool1) {
            console.log(this.string1, this.num1 + this.num2 + this.num3);
            return;
        }
        return "The value of bool1 is incorrect"
    }
}

This approach improves the developer experience of my code, because I no longer have to worry about feeding the WithDefaultParameters class with all the arguments. For quick tests, this is great, because I no longer need to worry about passing the proper arguments.

Additionally, this approach really shines when building inheritance hierarchies using classes, as it makes it possible to provide only the custom properties in the sub-class, while still accepting all the default parameters from the super-class constructor.

In conclusion, in this reading I've covered the following:
